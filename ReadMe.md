# 👋 Hi, I'm Virendar Oza

**AI Engineer | Production-Ready Generative AI Systems | Bengaluru**

I build scalable, production-ready AI systems that handle real-world complexity—latency, concurrency, hallucinations, and all.

---

## 🎯 What I Do

**Real-Time Voice AI:** Built a full-duplex Speech-to-Speech agent that handles 1,000+ concurrent users with **<150ms latency**.

**RAG at Scale:** Engineered retrieval systems for 50,000+ documents with **92% accuracy** using semantic chunking and hybrid search.

**Backend Excellence:** Production architectures with **99.8% uptime**, proper observability, error handling, and deployment pipelines.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Generative AI:** LangChain, RAG, OpenAI/Gemini, Ollama, Prompt Engineering, Ragas (eval frameworks)

**Backend & APIs:** FastAPI, WebSockets, Async Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, REST APIs

**Data & ML:** ChromaDB, Pinecone, FAISS, Hybrid Search, Vector Databases

**Infrastructure & DevOps:** Docker, AWS (EC2, S3), GitHub Actions, CI/CD, Linux, Deepgram API

## 📌 Featured Projects

### 1. **Real-Time Speech-to-Speech Voice Agent**
🔗 [`voice-agent-deepgram`](https://github.com/pepi-code-srt/voice-agent-deepgram)

Full-duplex voice agent using binary WebSocket streams. Handles 1,000+ concurrent users with <150ms latency.

**Stack:** FastAPI • WebSockets • Deepgram • PostgreSQL • Async Python

**Highlights:**
- 33% payload reduction via binary WebSockets
- Custom Ragas evaluation gate filters hallucinations
- Zero packet loss on 4G networks under load

---

### 2. **Advanced RAG Chatbot (Document Intelligence)**
🔗 [`rag-chatbot-gemini`](https://github.com/pepi-code-srt/rag-chatbot-gemini)

Retrieval system processing 50,000+ documents with 92% accuracy. Semantic chunking improved relevance by 24% over fixed-size chunking.

**Stack:** LangChain • ChromaDB • Gemini API • Semantic Chunking

**Highlights:**
- Hybrid Search (BM25 + Cosine Similarity)
- Ragas framework for faithfulness validation
- 12 minutes query time (down from 2 hours manual)

---

### 3. **Automated Sales Proposal Engine**
🔗 [`automated-sales-proposal`](https://github.com/pepi-code-srt/automated-sales-proposal)

Generates complex PDF proposals (100+ sections) using structured prompt chaining. Built with robust template engine.

**Stack:** Python • PDF Generation • LLM Prompt Chaining

**Highlights:**
- 95% time reduction (45 minutes → 90 seconds per proposal)
- 500+ proposals generated with 100% data accuracy
- Dynamic client data insertion

---

### 4. **Workflow Automation Platform**
🔗 [`workflow-automation`](https://github.com/pepi-code-srt/workflow-automation)

Automated 87% of manual workflows using n8n. Handles data sync, notifications, and complex integrations.

**Highlights:**
- 87% manual work reduction
- No-code automation with custom extensions
- Production-tested integrations

---

### 5. **Local LLM Docker App**
🔗 [`local-llm-docker`](https://github.com/pepi-code-srt/local-llm-docker)

Self-hosted Mistral LLM running locally with zero API costs. Docker-based deployment.

**Highlights:**
- Zero API costs
- Self-hosted privacy
- Easy Docker deployment
